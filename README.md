Is a custom compiler that designed for a programming language with specific syntax and semantics. Below are some of the key rules and features that can be inferred from the code:

1. Token Definitions:
The compiler uses a set of predefined tokens to represent different types of language constructs, such as keywords, operators, delimiters, and data types. For example, tokens for identifiers (id_tk), numbers (num_tk), and various operators (e.g., equal_tk, smaller_tk, greater_tk, etc.) are defined.

2. Finite State Machine (FSM):
The lexical analyzer (lexer) uses a finite state machine to process input characters and transition between different states based on the type of character encountered (e.g., letters, digits, punctuation). The METAVASEIS array defines the state transitions for different inputs.

3. Syntax Analysis:
The compiler includes a syntax analyzer (parser) that processes the tokens generated by the lexer to check for syntactic correctness. It defines rules for constructs such as programs, blocks, declarations, statements, expressions, and control flow constructs (if, while, etc.).

4. Scope Management:
The compiler manages variable scopes using a stack-like structure (scope), allowing for nested scopes (e.g., for functions and procedures). Each scope contains a list of entities (variables, parameters, functions) defined within that scope.

5. Symbol Table:
A symbol table is generated to keep track of variable and function definitions, their types, and their offsets. This is used for both semantic analysis and code generation.

6. Control Flow:
The compiler supports control flow constructs like if, while, do, for, and case statements. It generates intermediate code for these constructs and manages jumps and branching using quad instructions.

7. Expression and Statement Handling:
Expressions are evaluated based on operator precedence and associativity. The compiler can handle arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) and relational operations (e.g., <, >, =).

8. Function and Procedure Definitions:
The compiler supports defining and calling functions and procedures, including handling parameters (by value, by reference, or by copy).

9. Error Handling:
The compiler includes error handling mechanisms to report various kinds of syntax and semantic errors, such as using undefined variables or incorrect syntax.

10. Intermediate Code Generation:
The compiler generates intermediate code (using quadruples) for the program, which can later be translated into machine code or other forms of executable code.

11. Memory Management:
Temporary variables (e.g., for intermediate calculations) are created dynamically and stored in the symbol table.

12. Input and Output:
The code handles I/O operations, allowing for reading from input files and generating output files containing the intermediate representation.
